# Programming with Python

There are many reasons to learn programming, for instance it is fun. Programming
is also a good way to automate tedious or repetitive work, which can save you days or weeks of time.
A good way to learn how to program is to learn how to do something useful.
In this course, you will get started on doing empirical research on case law.

Computer programs are a bit like LEGO, they are made up of lots
of tiny parts. First, we’ll look at some of the parts, and study
how they work. Then we’ll put the parts together to make a larger
program that actually does something useful. Some of the examples
might be a bit silly and made up. However, when you first learned
to read, you probably didn’t start out with Shakespeare. Today
you are learning a new language.

We recommend using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html)
at the University of Oslo [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.uio.no/).
