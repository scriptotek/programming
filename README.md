# An Introduction to Programming

There are many reasons to learn programming, for instance it is fun.
Programming is creative problem-solving.
Programming is also a good way to automate tedious or repetitive work, which can save you days or weeks of time.
A good way to learn how to program is to learn how to do something useful.
In this course, you will get started on doing empirical research on case law,
or searching a library catalog.

Computer programs are a bit like LEGO, they are made up of lots
of tiny parts. First, we’ll look at some of the parts, and study
how they work. Then we’ll put the parts together to make a larger
program that actually does something useful. Some of the examples
might be a bit silly and made up. However, when you first learned
to read, you probably didn’t start out with Shakespeare.
Here, you will be learning a new language.

We recommend using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html)
at the University of Oslo [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.uio.no/).
If you don't have access to JupyterHub, you can use Google's
[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/scriptotek/programming-for-lawyers/).

Some of the lessons are based on material kindly provided by the
[IN1900]( https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN1900/h19/) team.
